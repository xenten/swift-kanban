        <div class="partner-net-objectives-webinar-heading"><strong>Building Great KanBan Boards for LeanNow&trade;</strong></div>
        For 60 years, Lean was a physical approach. It required time and resources to first reorganize the workplace, remove waste, and set up physical flow. LeanNow has changed that. Now we can implement flow first and then use it to manage lean results, remove waste with precision, and tighten flow. The electronic Kanban board is a critical technology. This webinar explains how to set up a Kanban board.&nbsp;<span>After attending this webinar, you will have the basic information needed to set up a successful electronic Kanban board for use with LeanNow.
