MOD_JW_SRFR_SIMPLE_RSS_FEED_READER_MODULE_BY_JOOMLAWORKS="<h2><a target='_blank' href='http://www.joomlaworks.gr/'>JoomlaWorks 'Simple RSS Feed Reader' Module v2.3</a></h2><a target='_blank' href='http://www.joomlaworks.gr/'><img style='float:right;background:#fff;border:none;padding:2px;margin:0 0 8px 8px;' src='../modules/mod_jw_srfr/includes/images/srfr_300x91_8.png' border='0' alt='Simple RSS Feed Reader' /></a>Adding RSS syndicated content inside your Joomla! website is now super-easy and simple with the '<b>Simple RSS Feed Reader</b>' Module from JoomlaWorks. All you have to do is insert the Feed (RSS) URLs of the websites you want to syndicate in the module's settings, publish the module in some position and that's it! You can even publish <b>multiple feeds</b> at the same time (meaning in the same module instance) and even filter the latest X number, which you specify in the module parameters!<br /><br />No messing with the code and no worrying about feed encoding. You can publish right away English along with Greek or Japanese feeds and have nothing to worry about!<br /><br />The '<b>Simple RSS Feed Reader</b>' module is based on the very popular <a target='_blank' href='http://www.simplepie.org'>SimplePie PHP Class</a>, which makes it easy to integrate syndicated content into your Joomla! website - and you don't even have to worry about what kind of feed it is! The '<b>Simple RSS Feed Reader</b>' module supports everything from the old-school RSS 0.91 and RSS 1.0 formats, to the ever-popular RSS 2.0 format, and also supports the emerging Atom format, in both 0.3 and 1.0 flavors. It has a very fast, very efficient caching system. By caching the processed data, rather than just the raw XML, the module is able to create a feed parser that's really, really quick.<br /><br />The feeds are stored inside Joomla!'s <b>cache</b> folder and refreshed in a specific time interval, which you set in the module's parameters.<br /><br />After you install the module, add one or more RSS feed sources in the related box under 'Fetch Options' and simply adjust the 'Feed Content Options' in the module parameters.<h2>Requirements</h2>In order for the module to work properly, your server must have the following PHP modules enabled: <b>cURL, iconv, PCRE, Zlib</b>. Don't worry, though, cause most servers have these PHP modules enabled by default. If not, then contact your hosting company to enable them.<br /><br />Please note that some RSS feeds might not display well even if you have the above PHP modules installed (rare occasion, but can happen). That is entirely based on how the server is <b>setup</b> and if the specific language -with which you have issues- is properly <b>defined</b> in the server. In any case, contacting your hosting company is always the best way to a proper solution.<h2>Styling</h2>The module already includes some generic CSS styling, which makes it truely '<b>plug and play</b>' for your Joomla! website. If you want more control, you can simply override both the generated HTML and CSS, using MVC template overrides within your Joomla! template.<h2>About</h2>You may also want to check out the following resources:<ul><li><a target='_blank' href='http://www.joomlaworks.gr/content/view/20/42/'>Product description</a></li><li><a target='_blank' title='Visit JoomlaWorks!' href='http://www.joomlaworks.gr/'>Learn more about all JoomlaWorks extensions for Joomla! and other systems</a></li><li>Please show your support in our work by rating and/or commenting on this extension at the official <a target='_blank' href='http://extensions.joomla.org/extensions/1723/details'>Joomla!
