                                    Hello,
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    <b>Digit&#233; Enterprise – End of Life (EOL) Announcement</b>
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    We are announcing the “End of Life” (EoL) of our Digit&#233; Enterprise product.  We will stop supporting the product, currently at v6.5, by December 31st, 2015.
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    We launched Digit&#233; Enterprise in 2002 and over the last 12 years, it has been the backbone not only of our business, but also that of our customers, especially IT consulting and services companies, who ran a substantial chunk of their business on their Digit&#233; Enterprise implementation. In the last 12 years, Digit&#233; Enterprise became an integral part of our customers' operations.  They are using it to collaborate with their customers or their own teams around the globe, to standardize and institutionalize their software development, maintenance and project management processes, or to provide enterprise-wide end-to-end visibility and project and enterprise-level dashboards for all aspects of their project execution.
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    During that time, the world has changed dramatically. Newer technologies in the areas of UI, Mobility, analytics and collaboration have made big leaps and brought the world closer together and connected 24x7. Without these technology enhancements, we would not be able to support our vision. For example, Analytics, including simulation and forecasting techniques, provide teams unprecedented ability to analyze project trends and to forecast future performance better than ever.  Enterprise software has also become driven by the User Experience (UX) and using a combination of UI, navigation, user context and domain awareness,  the user experience has become a key ingredient in helping teams use technology to collaborate better and produce greater, higher value outcomes – and at far greater levels of productivity than observed before.
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    At Digit&#233;, we have been hard at work to harness these developments – and make available the next generation platform and solutions that will help our customers stay ahead of the curve in terms of managing global engagements, delivering world-class products and services and helping them connect with their employees, customers and partners for dramatic gains in business, margins and long term successful relationships.
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    <b>SwiftALM!</b>
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    As you are aware, we announced the general availability of our new product SwiftALM almost a year back. SwiftALM represents a giant step forward in terms of UI, User Experience, visibility, mobility, collaboration and analytics. We already have a number of new customers on SwiftALM and many customers have upgraded from Digit&#233; Enterprise 6.5 to SwiftALM.  We are now pleased to offer it to all our customers. We are confident that SwiftALM will represent the next generation of capability for your organization to collaboratively deliver your products and services to your global customers.
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    SwiftALM comes with a number of dramatic new capabilities –
                                    <ul>

                                        <li>A new intuitive, fast and easy to navigate layout</li>
                                        <li>An upgraded STaRT module for simple project and resource management</li>
                                        <li>SwiftAnalytics – an optional powerful package for custom report and charts development without any coding</li>
                                        <li>SwiftRules – an optional versatile business rules engine for defining simple to sophisticated business rules to impact the behavior of workflow and other application events.</li>
                                        <li>SwiftSync – an optional enterprise-class enterprise Integration bus technology that allows you to integrate with more than 35 third-party software engineering and project management tools </li>
                                    </ul>
                                    This is not all. We continue to extend and improve SwiftALM. Some of the newer modules in the roadmap include a revamped Agile module, powerful collaboration capabilities, enhanced analytics with simulation and forecasting, enhanced program management, etc.
