                Dear <Attendee_First_Name>,  <br/><br/>
                    Thank you for the hospitality shown to us and for making us feel welcome as a sponsor of the
                    recently concluded Agile-Lean @Cisco Conference in San Jose, Ca. We truly enjoyed being there to
                    listen to some great keynotes, some energetic panels as well as some excellent discussions with
                    people who stopped by our booth.<br/><br/>
                    It was also pleasure to be able to speak at the conference and provide both introductory as well as
                    in-depth Lean/ Kanban sessions (<em>&ldquo;Why you should care about Kanban&rdquo; and &ldquo;Zero to Breakthrough &ndash; Lean
                    Innovation&rdquo;</em>) as well as a case study of our own product development using Kanban (<em>&ldquo;Product
                    Development Success Story with Kanban&rdquo;</em>). Thank you very much if you attended one of our sessions. In
                    case you missed them and would like to get a copy of the slides, these are available <a href="http://www.swift-kanban.com/cisco-presentation" target="_blank">here</a>. Please
                    feel free to download them and use them as you wish!<br/><br/>
                    It was heartening to learn of the various initiatives of implementing Lean and Kanban processes and
                    initiatives from several Cisco Lean/ Agile practitioners and Program Managers and Agile Coaches. It
                    was exciting to see the enthusiastic interest expressed by so many of you in the visual capabilities
                    of our product <strong>SwiftKanban</strong> and the potential benefits of using it in-house. We are honored to have
                    your consideration for the possible adoption of Swift-Kanban in Cisco. Several of you also expressed
                    enthusiasm that <a href="http://www.swift-kanban.com/swiftsync-integration" target="_blank"><em>we already integrate with Rally</em></a> which is used by a number of teams within Cisco &ndash;
                    and can provide a high level of sophisticated visualization capabilities to objects stored within
                    Rally.<br/><br/>
                    We would love to get a chance to talk to you more about SwiftKanban and perhaps to an opportunity to
                    show you a personalized demo. Please contact us at <a href="mailto:sales@digite.com">sales@digite.com</a> to schedule a call and a demo.
