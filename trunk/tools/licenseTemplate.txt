Dear $firstName,

Your Swift-Kanban account expired today. We waited for you this whole week, hoping that you wish to continue with us. But still have an entire day i.e today to re-activate your account and avoid account suspension. 

Drop us an email at $supportId and we would love to talk to you and understand where we went wrong and if you have any feedback for us to improve upon.

Thanks,
Swift-Kanban Team
